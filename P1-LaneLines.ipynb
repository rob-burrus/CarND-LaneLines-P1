Unfortunately, because of the reflectors on the road, both the position averages and the slope averages were heavily skewed and resulted in very jittery lanes from the \"noise\" of the reflectors and other arbitrary lines seen on the road. \n",

    "My final algorithm extrapolates the lane line from the largest detected line segment on each side. Both the average lane line position and lane line slope is taken from the largest line segment detected. This approach is good in that it is difficult to skew the slope or position of the resulting lane line. The algorithm would perform poorly if the road was on a sharp curve, or if some object / erroneous line on the road fooled the line detector. \n"
